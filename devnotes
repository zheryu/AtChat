DEVELOPER NOTES
===============

PSA
---
To start the app, run...
	Windows: SET DEBUG=AtChat:* & npm start
	Linux/Mac: DEBUG=AtChat:* npm start
You will need to globally install grunt (npm install -g grunt-cli) to compile the bootstrap package
'/routes' = Controllers

TODO
----
1. Finish migration from old app. This means having a fully set up login and registration, and the basic chat.
2. provide support for the verbatim command.
3. improve chat views so they don't look like shit.
4. provide support for the games and minirooms.
5. List of games:
	RPS - 2 player
		opt: rps tournament
	Coin/Dice
	Guess the number
	


Conventions
-----------
1. Camel case only in code. Underscores are for file names
2. Try to not use knex.raw().
3. This app follows MVC architecture.
	Models go in the 'models' folder.
	Views go in the 'views' folder.
	Controllers go in the 'routes' folder.
